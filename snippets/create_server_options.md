Before you begin, open this experiment on Trovi:

* Use this link: [ML Experiment Tracking with MLFlow](https://chameleoncloud.org/experiment/share/aefd5288-b99c-455d-8a85-028d4aad3209) on Trovi
* Then, click “Launch on Chameleon”. This will start a new Jupyter server for you, with the experiment materials already in it.

## Launch and set up server - options

The next step will be to provision the bare metal server you have reserved, and configure it to run the containers associated with our experiment. The specific details will depend on what type of GPU server you have reserved - 

* If you have reserved an AMD GPU server, work through the notebook `1_create_server_amd.ipynb` inside the Chameleon Jupyter environment. 
* If you have reserved an NVIDIA GPU server, work through the notebook `1_create_server_nvidia.ipynb`  inside the Chameleon Jupyter environment. 

After you have finished setting up the server, you will return to this page for the next section.
